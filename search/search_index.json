It works using small, battery-powered radio devices that create a network\u2014called a \"mesh\"\u2014where each device helps relay messages to others. This means you can stay in touch with friends or teammates even in remote places like mountains, forests, or during emergencies when regular networks go down.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to get started: just pair a Meshtastic device with your phone using Bluetooth, and use the app to chat or share your location. The more devices around, the stronger and farther the network can reach. Whether you're hiking, off-grid camping, or preparing for a natural disaster, Meshtastic gives you a private, low-cost way to stay connected\u2014without relying on big tech companies or cell towers.</p>"},{"location":"meshtastic.html#channels","title":"Channels","text":"<p>Channels in Meshtastic are like private chat rooms that devices use to communicate. Each channel has a unique name, encryption key, and index slot that must match exactly across devices for them to talk to each other. You can use multiple channels at once (up to 8), each serving a different purpose\u2014like one for chatting, another for sensor data, or a group-specific channel. The table below lists some common channel configurations you can use or customize to connect with others or organize your own mesh network.</p> Channel Name Index Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Description LongFast 0 AQ== Default communication channel.
