## Role in Key Incidents

Deputy Marc King is a deputy with the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office. He is the brother of Sheriff Mat King.

## November 6, 2022 OWI Arrest

On November 6, 2022, Deputy Marc King was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). Key facts:

- Arrested for drunk driving while off-duty
- Transported to Lapeer County Jail (not the St. Clair County Jail)
- His brother, Sheriff Mat King, was notified the same day
- The subsequent investigation was handled internally by the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office

## Concerns Raised

The arrest itself is not the primary concern documented in this project. The concern is what happened afterward:

- No independent investigation was conducted
- The Sheriff (his brother) did not recuse himself
- Close friends of Deputy King were involved in the investigation
- Evidence (text messages) was later deleted by multiple parties

## Why This Matters

When a law enforcement officer is arrested, the integrity of any subsequent investigation depends on independence and transparency. In this case:

- The investigating agency was led by the arrestee's brother
- Investigators had personal relationships with the subject
- Standard protocols for handling officer misconduct were not followed

This case illustrates what happens when accountability mechanisms fail.
