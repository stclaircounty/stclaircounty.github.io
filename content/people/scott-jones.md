## Role

Scott E. Jones served as a Lieutenant within the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office before his retirement in January 2023.

## Whistleblower Actions

Following the November 6, 2022 OWI arrest of Deputy Marc King (Sheriff Mat King's brother), Lieutenant Jones reported concerns about the handling of the matter to Human Resources. According to court filings, he raised issues regarding:

- Conflicts of interest in the internal investigation
- Failure to engage an independent outside agency
- Command staff involvement despite familial relationships

## Federal Litigation

Lieutenant Jones is the plaintiff in *Jones v. St. Clair County, et al.* (Case No. 2:24-cv-11965), filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

### Claims

- **First Amendment Retaliation** (42 U.S.C. § 1983): Alleging retaliation for protected speech when he reported concerns about misconduct
- **Procedural Due Process** (Fourteenth Amendment): Constitutional claims related to his separation from employment
- **Monell Liability**: Municipal liability claims against St. Clair County

### Key Rulings

In 2025, Judge Nancy G. Edmunds denied summary judgment in part:

- First Amendment retaliation claim **survived** summary judgment
- Qualified immunity was **denied** for surviving claims
- Monell municipal liability claims allowed to **proceed**
- Case is proceeding toward trial

## Public Interest Context

Whistleblower and retaliation allegations in law enforcement agencies are a recognized matter of public concern. Officers who raise concerns about misconduct play an important role in accountability, and the law provides protections for such speech under the First Amendment.

## Note

As a plaintiff alleging retaliation for whistleblowing, Lieutenant Jones's credibility assessment differs from those accused of misconduct. This profile reflects publicly documented court filings and legal posture.
