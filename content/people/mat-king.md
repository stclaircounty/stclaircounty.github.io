## Role in Key Incidents

Sheriff Mat King is the elected Sheriff of St. Clair County, Michigan. He is the brother of {{< person "marc-king" >}}, who was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) on November 6, 2022.

## November 2022 OWI Incident

When his brother was arrested for drunk driving, Sheriff King did not recuse himself from the matter. According to sworn testimony and documented evidence:

- Sheriff King was notified of his brother's arrest the same day it occurred
- He contacted {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} and {{< person "jim-spadafore" >}} regarding the incident
- No independent investigation was initiated
- No external agency was engaged to handle the matter
- The Sheriff maintained involvement despite the obvious familial conflict of interest

## Governance Concerns

The Sheriff's handling of his brother's arrest raises serious questions about:

- **Conflict of Interest**: No recusal despite direct family relationship to the arrestee
- **Command Interference**: Direct involvement in a matter where he should have been recused
- **Oversight Failure**: No independent investigation mechanism was utilized
- **Policy Gaps**: No written policy requiring recusal in such circumstances

## Deposition

Sheriff Mat King provided sworn testimony regarding these events. His deposition is available for review.
