And you also call and text with Mat King, correct?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="11" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}

{{< /quote >}}

## Why This Matters

### Conflict of Interest Framework

These established relationships create significant conflict-of-interest concerns when:

1. **Deputy Duva was called to retrieve Marc King from jail** after the OWI arrest
2. **Deputy Duva transported Marc King** rather than following standard procedures
3. **Sheriff Mat King did not recuse himself** from oversight of matters involving his brother
4. **Personal loyalties may have influenced** how the arrest was handled internally

### Pattern of Close Relationships

The testimony reveals a pattern where:
- Professional and personal relationships overlapped significantly
- Deputies socialized regularly with both the Sheriff and his brother
- Communication channels existed outside official department systems
- Family relationships extended the network of connections

## Connection to November 2022 Events

These pre-existing relationships directly affected how the OWI arrest was handled:

- [OWI Arrest](/timeline/2022-11-06-owi-arrest/): The arrest that tested these relationships
- [Duva Retrieves Marc King](/timeline/2022-11-06-duva-retrieves-marc/): Duva's personal relationship influenced his involvement
- [Sheriff Notified](/timeline/2022-11-06-sheriff-notified/): Informal notification through personal channels

## Key Questions

1. Should officers with close personal relationships have been involved in handling this matter?
2. Did the department have policies addressing conflicts of interest for family members of leadership?
3. How did these relationships affect the objectivity of internal handling?
