## Event Summary

Between 2022 and 2024, multiple officers involved in the Marc King OWI matter admitted in sworn testimony that text messages relevant to the incident were deleted or lost.

## Who Deleted Evidence

### Captain Matthew Pohl
- Admitted in deposition to deleting text messages
- These messages were relevant to the November 2022 incident
- Close personal friend of Deputy Marc King

### Deputy Duva
- Admitted in sworn testimony to deleted or lost text messages
- Communications from the relevant time period are missing
- Close personal friend of Deputy Marc King

## Why This Matters

### Legal Implications

The deletion of evidence relevant to a foreseeable legal matter has serious consequences:

- **Adverse Inference**: Courts may instruct juries to assume the deleted evidence was unfavorable to the party that destroyed it
- **Discovery Sanctions**: Parties can face penalties for destroying relevant evidence
- **Evidence Tampering**: Under Michigan law (MCL 750.491), tampering with evidence is a criminal offense
- **Spoliation Doctrine**: The intentional destruction of evidence can result in severe legal consequences

### Pattern of Behavior

The fact that multiple officers—all close to the arrestee—deleted communications suggests a coordinated effort to eliminate evidence rather than coincidental data loss.

## No Litigation Hold

A "litigation hold" is a standard procedure requiring preservation of all potentially relevant documents when legal action is foreseeable. In this case:

- No litigation hold was established
- No retention policies were enforced
- Personal devices were used for official communications without preservation requirements
- The foreseeable nature of legal consequences makes the failure to preserve evidence particularly troubling

## Questions Raised

- What was in the deleted messages?
- Who else deleted communications?
- Was there coordination in the deletion of evidence?
- Why were no preservation protocols followed?
