## Event Summary

Deposition testimony revealed significant gaps between the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office stated policies and actual practices in handling {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s arrest and its aftermath. Multiple procedures were bypassed or ignored.

## Policy Gaps Identified

### 1. No Retention Policy for Communications

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} confirmed no policy exists for preserving text messages:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="14" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
What's your deletion policy?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="14" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I don't think we have a policy that covers deletion.

### 2. Improper Handling of Intoxicated Detainee

{{< person "damon-duva" >}} acknowledged not following proper procedures when transporting {{< person "marc-king" >}} from jail:

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="23" deposition="duva-deposition" >}}
I guess I didn't take the proper procedures to double [check].
{{< /quote >}}

The decision to house Marc King at the detective bureau rather than following normal booking procedures was questioned:

{{< quote source="Deposition" page="67" deposition="duva-deposition" >}}
[You don't] house people that you bring in that you've arrested in the detective bureau, correct? That's not the normal procedure?
{{< /quote >}}

### 3. Policy Modernization Efforts

Captain Pohl described ongoing efforts to update policies through a partnership with Lexipol:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="9" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
Currently we have partnered with Lexipol, so we are redoing our whole policy and procedure. So I meet weekly with a representative and we go over our current policies as they update them and format them in their wording. This might be a yearlong process.

## Conflicts of Interest in Internal Investigations

Testimony revealed how rank affects who conducts investigations:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="20" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
It would depend on who the investigation is on. Sometimes rank would play a role in that... we would prefer that lieutenants do investigations of members on their shift or could be anyone of lower rank. If it was a lieutenant or higher then it makes sense myself as the captain that I should do that investigation so a lieutenant wouldn't be investigating a fellow lieutenant of the same rank.

This raises questions about who would appropriately investigate a case involving the Sheriff's brother.

## Work Schedule Conflict

{{< person "damon-duva" >}} was questioned about returning {{< person "marc-king" >}} home knowing he was scheduled for work:

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="80" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
But you knew Marcus was supposed to report to work at 10:00 a.m., right?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="80" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
So, you knew that he was going to -- you know, at 10:00 a.m., you know, an hour after you're taking him home, he's supposed to be at work? You knew that, right?
{{< /quote >}}

## Why This Matters

### Systemic Issues

The testimony reveals several systemic problems:

1. **Policy Vacuum**: No policies existed for key areas like communication retention
2. **Informal Decision-Making**: Procedures were bypassed based on personal relationships
3. **Conflict of Interest Structure**: The rank-based investigation system created blind spots for cases involving leadership
4. **Modernization Lag**: Policy updates were still "a yearlong process" in progress

### Impact on Accountability

Without clear policies and consistent enforcement:
- Officers had discretion to handle sensitive situations informally
- Evidence could be deleted without consequence
- Personal relationships influenced official actions

## Connection to Other Events

- [Duva Retrieves Marc King](/timeline/2022-11-06-duva-retrieves-marc/): The transport that bypassed normal procedures
- [Text Retention Issues](/timeline/2022-11-06-texts-retention-and-availability/): Evidence of policy gaps in communication retention
- [Evidence Deleted](/timeline/2022-2024-evidence-deleted/): Consequence of no retention policy

## Open Questions

1. Have the Lexipol policy updates been completed?
2. What policies now exist for handling cases involving relatives of leadership?
3. Has a retention policy been implemented?
4. Were any disciplinary actions taken for policy violations?
