## Event Summary

In the early morning hours following {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, {{< person "damon-duva" >}} - a close personal friend of both King brothers - drove to Lapeer County to retrieve Marc King and transport him to the St. Clair County Detective Bureau.

## Timeline of Events

- {{< person "damon-duva" >}} receives call from {{< person "phil-pokriefka" >}} about the arrest

- {{< person "scott-braun" >}} comes on duty
- {{< person "nate-zuzga" >}} eventually relieves Duva

## Why This Matters

The decision to send a close personal friend to retrieve the arrested deputy raises questions:

- **Personal Relationship**: Duva testified he had known Marc King for 15-20 years as a close friend
- **No Documentation**: No reports were created at the time documenting this transport
- **Informal Handling**: The matter was handled informally rather than through standard protocols
- **Union President**: Duva was the union president at the time, creating additional complexity

## Sworn Testimony

In his deposition, Deputy Duva testified:

> "I've known Mat King for probably around 20 years or more... We were partners for a while in the car."

> "I would think probably around 4, 4:15-ish" when asked about arrival at the Detective Bureau.

> "Until 9:00... You sat there the whole time?... And he sat there the whole time?"
