## Event Summary

On November 23, 2022 - seventeen days after the arrest - {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} formally opened an internal investigation file regarding {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest.

## Timeline Gap

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| November 6, 2022 | Marc King arrested for OWI at ~1:30 a.m. |
| November 6, 2022 | Sheriff Mat King notified |
| November 8-10, 2022 | Social media posts appear |
| **November 23, 2022** | Investigation file opened (17 days later) |

## What the Testimony Shows

From Captain Pohl's deposition:

> "On November 23rd a file was opened; is that what you're saying?"

The file was designated as the 11th internal investigation of 2022.

## Delayed Documentation

According to testimony, a supplemental report was also created on November 23rd regarding the events of November 6th. This means critical documentation was created more than two weeks after the incident occurred.

## Why the Delay Matters

- Evidence preservation becomes more difficult over time
- Witness memories fade
- The delay allowed time for potential coordination of accounts
- Text messages from the time period were later deleted by multiple parties

## Related Events

- {{< person "marc-king" >}} continued working during this 17-day gap
- No administrative action was taken during this period
- The Sheriff (Marc's brother) did not recuse himself
