## Event Summary

In the early morning hours of November 6, 2022, following {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, information about the arrest flowed through the chain of command. This notification process occurred through both formal and informal channels, raising questions about how sensitive information involving the Sheriff's brother was handled.

## Timeline of Notifications

### ~3:00 AM: Initial Notifications

{{< person "scott-jones" >}}, the on-scene supervisor, attempted to notify command staff:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="15" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
I had awoken and missed a call and/or voicemail from Scott Jones as to the arrest of Marc King.
{{< /quote >}}

### ~3:00-3:30 AM: Sheriff Notified

{{< person "damon-duva" >}} contacted Sheriff {{< person "mat-king" >}} to inform him of his brother's arrest.

*(See [Sheriff Notified](/timeline/2022-11-06-sheriff-notified/) for conflicting testimony about exact timing)*

### Morning: Captain Pohl Informed

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} learned of the arrest when he checked his phone after waking:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="15" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
So I assume you were texting with the sheriff and/or with Marcus beginning on or around 11/6/2022; correct? Things were happening and, you know, at the time of the arrest and there was some communication; correct?

## Deputy Duva's Role

{{< person "damon-duva" >}} was questioned about his involvement:

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="31" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
Do you recall that Marcus King was arrested for OWI on November 6 of 2022?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="31" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
And it was in the early morning hours. So, you know, night of November 5th, early morning of November 6th. And you were involved in the arrest, right?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="31" deposition="duva-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I was not involved with the arrest.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="31" deposition="duva-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I played a role, but I was not involved in the arrest.
{{< /quote >}}

This distinction is important—Duva participated in post-arrest handling but was not part of the arresting team.

## Communication About the Arrest

### Text and Phone Communications

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="8" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
Did you call or text with Marcus about his OWI arrest in 2022?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="8" deposition="duva-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I spoke with Marcus. I did not text him the night of his OWI arrest. No, I did not.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="8" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
Not the night of, but you texted him in the November timeframe about the arrest?
{{< /quote >}}

## Arrest Details Known to Command

Command staff were aware of key details including the breath test results:

Do you recall learning what Marcus's PBT results were upon his arrest?

## Why This Matters

### 1. Informal vs. Formal Notification

The arrest of a deputy—especially the Sheriff's brother—triggered notifications through personal relationships rather than strictly formal channels:
- Deputy Duva called the Sheriff directly
- Personal phone calls preceded official documentation
- Friends within the department learned quickly

### 2. Conflict of Interest Activated

The moment the Sheriff learned his brother was arrested, a conflict of interest existed. Questions include:
- Who should have been notified first?
- Should the Sheriff have immediately recused himself?
- Was an external agency contacted?

### 3. Information Flow Pattern

The notification pattern reveals how information moved through the department:
- On-scene supervisor (Jones) → Captain Pohl (voicemail)
- Deputy Duva → Sheriff Mat King (direct call)
- Informal networks spread information quickly
