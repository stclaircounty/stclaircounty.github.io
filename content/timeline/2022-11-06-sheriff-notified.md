## Event Summary

On the same day as {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, {{< person "mat-king" >}} was notified of his brother's arrest. Rather than recusing himself from the matter, the Sheriff became directly involved.

## What Happened

According to sworn testimony:

- {{< person "mat-king" >}} learned of his brother's arrest on November 6, 2022
- He contacted {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} regarding the incident
- He contacted {{< person "jim-spadafore" >}}
- Command-level discussions occurred about how to handle the matter

## The Failure Point

This was the critical moment where proper governance should have intervened:

### What Should Have Happened

- {{< person "mat-king" >}} should have immediately recused himself
- An external agency should have been contacted to handle the investigation
- All communications should have been documented and preserved
- A clear chain of custody should have been established

### What Actually Happened

- No recusal occurred
- No external agency was engaged
- The Sheriff maintained involvement in the matter
- Communications were handled informally
- Text messages were later deleted

## Significance

This moment represents the governance failure at its core. When the Sheriff chose not to recuse himself, every subsequent action was tainted by the conflict of interest. The integrity of any investigation was compromised before it began.
