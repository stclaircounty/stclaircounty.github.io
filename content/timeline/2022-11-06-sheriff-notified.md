## Event Summary

In the early morning hours of November 6, 2022, following {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, a notification chain was activated. Rather than recusing himself, {{< person "mat-king" >}} became directly involved in the matter.

## What Happened

According to sworn testimony, there is conflicting testimony about when the Sheriff was notified:

### Notification Chain (per Deputy Duva)

- **~2:30-3:00 a.m.**: {{< person "phil-pokriefka" >}} (Union VP) called {{< person "damon-duva" >}} (Union President) to inform him of the arrest
- **~3:00-3:30 a.m.**: {{< person "damon-duva" >}} attempted to call {{< person "mat-king" >}}; the Sheriff did not answer initially
- **Shortly after**: {{< person "mat-king" >}} called {{< person "damon-duva" >}} back
- **~3:00 a.m.**: {{< person "damon-duva" >}} also contacted {{< person "scott-jones" >}}

### Sheriff's Account (per Mat King)

- {{< person "mat-king" >}} stated in his deposition he was notified **"mid-morning -- 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, sometime like that"**
- He contacted {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} and {{< person "jim-spadafore" >}} regarding the incident
- He stated this occurred **"sometime around the same -- mid-morning hours"**

### Conflicting Testimony

**Note:** There is a significant discrepancy between these accounts. Deputy Duva testified he called the Sheriff at approximately 3:00-3:30 a.m. and received a callback, while Sheriff Mat King testified he was notified mid-morning (10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.).

## The Failure Point

This was the critical moment where proper governance should have intervened:

### What Should Have Happened

- {{< person "mat-king" >}} should have immediately recused himself
- An external agency should have been contacted to handle the investigation
- All communications should have been documented and preserved
- A clear chain of custody should have been established

### What Actually Happened

- No recusal occurred
- No external agency was engaged
- The Sheriff maintained involvement in the matter
- Communications were handled informally
- Text messages were later deleted

## Significance

This moment represents the governance failure at its core. When the Sheriff chose not to recuse himself, every subsequent action was tainted by the conflict of interest. The integrity of any investigation was compromised before it began.
