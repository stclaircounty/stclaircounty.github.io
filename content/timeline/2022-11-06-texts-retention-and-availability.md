## Event Summary

Beginning on November 6, 2022, multiple officers communicated about {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s arrest via text messages and phone calls. These communications were later deleted, and testimony revealed that the department had no retention policy for such communications.

## Key Finding: No Retention Policy

When asked about policies governing deletion of communications:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="14" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
What's your deletion policy?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="14" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I don't think we have a policy that covers deletion.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="16" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
And what's the retention policy on that?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="16" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
We don't have a policy.

## Captain Pohl's Admission

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} admitted to regularly deleting communications:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="14" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
I just like to periodically clean things up, both work e-mail, phones.
{{< /quote >}}

When asked about specific communications from November 2022:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="15" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
Whatever text messages or phone calls that I'd referenced in my internal report, I no longer have those on my phone.
{{< /quote >}}

## Deputy Duva's Admission

{{< person "damon-duva" >}} also confirmed deleting text messages:

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="9" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
Did you delete the texts?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="9" deposition="duva-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I'm sure I've deleted some, yeah.
{{< /quote >}}

Duva also mentioned switching phone carriers as a reason for lost messages:

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="9" deposition="duva-deposition" >}}
I think I switched carriers on my phone and I've gotten rid of most of them.
{{< /quote >}}

## Why This Matters

### 1. Evidence Preservation Failure

Communications about a potential conflict-of-interest situation involving the Sheriff's brother were not preserved. This creates a significant gap in the evidentiary record.

### 2. Policy Vacuum

The absence of any retention policy means:
- Officers could delete communications without violating policy
- No accountability mechanism exists for preserving evidence
- Potential misconduct cannot be fully investigated

### 3. Pattern of Unavailability

Multiple officers independently deleted relevant communications:
- Captain Pohl deleted texts referenced in his internal report
- Deputy Duva deleted texts about the arrest
- No records remain of key conversations

## Connection to Other Events

- [Information Sharing to Goodrich](/timeline/2022-11-06-information-sharing-to-goodrich/): The communications that were later deleted
- [Evidence Deleted 2022-2024](/timeline/2022-2024-evidence-deleted/): Broader pattern of evidence spoliation
- [Policy Awareness vs Practice](/timeline/2022-11-08-policy-awareness-vs-practice/): Gap between stated policy and actual practice

## Open Questions

1. Were any text messages preserved by phone carriers?
2. Has the department since adopted a retention policy?
3. Were any litigation hold notices issued?
4. What other communications may have been deleted?
