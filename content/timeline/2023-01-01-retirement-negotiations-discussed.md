## Overview

Following the internal investigation into {{< person "scott-jones" >}}'s handling of the {{< person "marc-king" >}} arrest, retirement negotiations began. These discussions would determine how Jones' separation from the Sheriff's Office would be characterized—a decision with significant implications for his career record and the department's accountability reporting to MCOLES (Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards).

## The Retirement Process

### Sheriff-Led Initiative

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} revealed that the retirement arrangement was spearheaded by {{< person "mat-king" >}} himself:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="252" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I believe this was from the sheriff. I'd never been a part of anything like this as far as a letter of intent to retire. I had only been upstairs, you know, a year or so. So this was kind of more spearheaded by him and how this could actually -- or, might actually play out.
{{< /quote >}}

This testimony indicates the Sheriff personally directed how the separation would be structured.

### Timing and Context

The retirement came immediately following the investigation:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="223" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
Okay. Thank you for that. There's a reason he retired; correct, just right on the heels of your investigation?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="223" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
Well, that's only known to him why he retired.
{{< /quote >}}

Pohl's non-committal response is notable—the timing strongly suggests the retirement was connected to the investigation, but he declined to state this directly.

## MCOLES Reporting Categories

### The Significance of Separation Codes

When an officer separates from employment, the department must report the reason to MCOLES. The deposition explored the available categories:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="49" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
I'm going to tell you what I understand the categories are, and tell me if this sounds correct to you, for separation reasons. Deceased, retirement, retired in good standing, retired while under investigation, retired while under criminal charges, retired in lieu of termination.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Mr. Shoudy" page="50" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
Yeah. The one you have, of course, was because it involved a retirement, it's under the retirement line and you click on that and then there's a drop-down box that you're seeing there.
{{< /quote >}}

### Why This Matters

The category selected determines:
- **Future employment** - Other agencies can see why an officer separated
- **Certification status** - Some categories may trigger decertification proceedings
- **Public record** - The characterization becomes part of the officer's permanent record
- **Accountability** - "Retired in good standing" vs. "Retired while under investigation" tells very different stories

## Union Involvement in Negotiations

{{< person "steve-sellers" >}} played an active role in the retirement process:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="185" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
From what I recall, Business Agent Sellers asked for...
{{< /quote >}}

And Sellers was present at the key meetings:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="216" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
The -- if you want to call it the investigative interview, but it was the second interview I had with Jones. The first was the HR setting; this would be the one with Business Agent Sellers present.

## Historical Context

### Retirement Under Investigation

When asked whether this pattern occurred previously:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="48" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
Have you had people retire under investigation other than my client?
{{< /quote >}}

The question probes whether Jones' situation was unusual or part of a pattern at the Sheriff's Office.

### MCOLES Reporting Requirements

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="49" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
Okay. And when an officer retires or separates you fill out a form that goes to MCOLES; is that correct?
{{< /quote >}}

This establishes that separation reporting to MCOLES is a required administrative step—not optional.
