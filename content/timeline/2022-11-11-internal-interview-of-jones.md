## Overview

Five days after {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, {{< person "scott-jones" >}} sat for his formal internal investigative interview. {{< person "steve-sellers" >}}, the POAM Business Agent, was present as union representation. This interview was the culmination of Internal Investigation 22-11 and would shape Jones' employment future with the Sheriff's Office.

## The Interview Process

### Two Separate Interviews

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}}'s deposition clarifies that Jones went through two distinct interview processes:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="216" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
The -- if you want to call it the investigative interview, but it was the second interview I had with Jones. The first was the HR setting; this would be the one with Business Agent Sellers present.
{{< /quote >}}

The distinction matters:
- **First interview (HR setting)** - Likely without union representation, potentially addressing administrative matters
- **Second interview (Investigative)** - With {{< person "steve-sellers" >}} present, formal investigation under Garrity protections

### Garrity Rights and Procedure

In internal investigations, officers receive Garrity warnings—a protection derived from *Garrity v. New Jersey* (1967). {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} described the standard procedure:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="28" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
That goes to -- so I would read that verbatim and then we give a copy to the deputy who's involved and then his union representation.
{{< /quote >}}

This means both Jones and {{< person "steve-sellers" >}} would have received copies of the Garrity warning and any related documentation.

## What Was Investigated

### The "Loyalty" Investigation

The investigation, designated 22-11, focused on {{< person "scott-jones" >}} and {{< person "chad-cronkright" >}}, with "Loyalty" as the subject:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="51" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
I have something entitled, Internal Investigation, number 22-11, Scott Jones/Chad Cronkright Loyalty. You've looked at that recently, I assume?
{{< /quote >}}

### "Questionable Behavior" Examined

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="26" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
It came to light that he had been displaying some questionable behavior. We looked into it. We interviewed fellow deputies that were present. Looked into policies, what might -- may have been violated.
{{< /quote >}}

The investigation examined whether Jones violated department policies in how he handled information about the {{< person "marc-king" >}} arrest.

## Findings and Outcome

### Conclusions Made, No Charges Filed

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} made conclusions in his investigation:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="31" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
Okay. Well, you have -- you have statements in Scott Jones's -- your memo or your investigation as to rule violations where you made findings.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="32" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
-- for the Scott Jones, where I made a conclusion at the very end --
{{< /quote >}}

Yet despite these findings, no formal charges were prepared:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="31" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
When we mete out discipline, so there was -- I never prepared a statement of charges for Scott Jones. For Marcus King I did and I was involved in both investigations.
{{< /quote >}}

### Pohl's Limited Role

Pohl clarified his involvement stopped short of the disciplinary phase:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="31" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I just want to say, however I was never involved into the disciplinary hearing with Scott Jones, so I never --
{{< /quote >}}

## Jones' Background and Job Description

The deposition established Jones' role within the department:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="37" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
My client, Scott Jones, has a job description; is that accurate?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="41" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
Okay. Next is, Implements, coordinates and supervises crime prevention programs which are presented to the community as a means of educating citizens. I think that probably speaks for itself.
{{< /quote >}}

Jones' public-facing role in community education would later become relevant to questions about his conduct.

## Timeline Context

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Nov 6, 2022 | Marc King OWI arrest; Jones notifies command |
| Nov 9, 2022 | Union representative Steve Sellers contacted |
| Nov 10, 2022 | Internal interview planned |
| **Nov 11, 2022** | **Internal interview of Jones conducted (Sellers present)** |
| Late 2022 | Investigation concludes with findings |
| Early 2023 | Retirement negotiations |

## Why This Matters

### 1. Formal Process With Limited Consequence

Despite a formal investigation with findings of policy violations, no statement of charges was ever filed. The investigation culminated in retirement rather than discipline.

### 2. Union Protection in Action

{{< person "steve-sellers" >}}'s presence ensured Jones had contractual protections throughout the investigative interview. Union involvement would continue through the retirement negotiation process.

### 3. Differential Treatment Visible

The contrast between Jones (investigated, findings made, no charges, retirement) and {{< person "marc-king" >}} (investigated, charges prepared) raises questions about how similarly-situated officers are treated.

### 4. Documentation Created

This interview would have generated documentation—interview transcripts, notes, findings—that should be part of the investigative file.
