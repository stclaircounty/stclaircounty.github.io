## Event Summary

On November 7, 2022—one day after {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest—internal discussions took place regarding text message communications related to the incident. These discussions led to the creation of documentation that would later be referenced in the internal investigation.

## Text Messages Documented

### Cronkright-Goodrich Communications

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} testified that text message screenshots were included in investigation files:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="59" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
Facebook posts and then there's two, like, text message screenshot pages.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="59" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
Between Chad Cronkright and Josh Goodrich, those are in there. There is a written statement from Chad Cronkright is in there.

### Documentation Created

The internal report referenced various text communications:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="17" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
I went over the internal report. Some policies that were referenced in the internal report, some text [messages].

## The Paradox of Documentation

### Messages Referenced but Not Preserved

A critical issue emerged: while text messages were referenced in official reports, the messages themselves were later deleted:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="15" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
Whatever text messages or phone calls that I'd referenced in my internal report, I no longer have those on my phone.
{{< /quote >}}

This creates a situation where:
1. Internal reports reference specific communications
2. Screenshots of some messages were preserved
3. The original messages were deleted
4. Complete verification is now impossible

## Social Media Documentation

In addition to text messages, social media communications were also documented:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="59" deposition="pohl-deposition" >}}
There's copies of Facebook and Facebook messages are in there.

## Why This Matters

### 1. Selective Preservation

The documentation process appears to have been selective:
- Some messages were screenshot and preserved
- Other messages were deleted
- The criteria for what was kept vs. deleted is unclear

### 2. Evidence Chain Issues

For a proper investigation, evidence should be:
- Preserved in original form
- Protected from deletion
- Available for independent review

The pattern here raises questions about evidence integrity.

### 3. Internal Report Limitations

Internal reports that reference deleted communications cannot be fully verified. This undermines:
- The credibility of the investigation
- The ability to conduct independent review
- Public confidence in the process

## Connection to Other Events

- [Information Sharing to Goodrich](/timeline/2022-11-06-information-sharing-to-goodrich/): The communications being discussed
- [Text Retention Issues](/timeline/2022-11-06-texts-retention-and-availability/): The broader retention problem
- [Evidence Deleted](/timeline/2022-2024-evidence-deleted/): Pattern of evidence destruction
- [Social Media Posts](/timeline/2022-11-08-social-media-posts/): Public disclosure of the arrest

## Key Questions

1. What criteria determined which messages were screenshotted vs. deleted?
2. Who decided what to include in the internal report?
3. Were any messages excluded from documentation that should have been included?
4. Is there a way to recover the deleted communications?
5. Were litigation hold procedures followed once it was clear legal action was possible?
