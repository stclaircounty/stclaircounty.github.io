## Overview

Four days after {{< person "marc-king" >}}'s OWI arrest, {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} and command staff began planning the internal interview of {{< person "scott-jones" >}}. This planning phase reveals how the Sheriff's Office structured its internal investigation—and the distinction between HR-related interviews and formal investigative interviews.

## The Investigation Process

### Dual Interview Approach

{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}}'s deposition reveals that {{< person "scott-jones" >}} was interviewed in two separate settings:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="216" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
The -- if you want to call it the investigative interview, but it was the second interview I had with Jones. The first was the HR setting; this would be the one with Business Agent Sellers present.
{{< /quote >}}

This two-phase approach indicates:
1. **HR interview** - Initial meeting without union representation
2. **Investigative interview** - Formal interview with {{< person "steve-sellers" >}} (union) present

### Scope of Investigation

The investigation examined {{< person "scott-jones" >}}'s conduct following the arrest:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="26" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
It came to light that he had been displaying some questionable behavior. We looked into it. We interviewed fellow deputies that were present. Looked into policies, what might -- may have been violated.

## Key Investigation Details

### Investigation Number and Focus

The formal investigation was designated Internal Investigation 22-11, focusing on Jones and {{< person "chad-cronkright" >}}:

{{< quote source="Questioning Attorney" page="51" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="question" >}}
I have something entitled, Internal Investigation, number 22-11, Scott Jones/Chad Cronkright Loyalty. You've looked at that recently, I assume?
{{< /quote >}}

The investigation title—"Loyalty"—is notable, suggesting the focus was on whether Jones and Cronkright improperly disclosed information about the arrest.

### Pohl's Role vs. Outcome

While {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} participated in the investigation, he was not involved in the actual disciplinary hearing:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="31" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I just want to say, however I was never involved into the disciplinary hearing with Scott Jones, so I never --
{{< /quote >}}

And critically, unlike the parallel investigation of {{< person "marc-king" >}}, no statement of charges was ever prepared for Jones:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="31" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
When we mete out discipline, so there was -- I never prepared a statement of charges for Scott Jones. For Marcus King I did and I was involved in both investigations.
{{< /quote >}}

## The Sheriff's Accountability Structure

Deposition testimony also revealed the unique position of the Sheriff as an elected official:

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="47" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
Right. He would appear at county commissioner meetings, department head meetings, maybe any ad hoc meeting that would arise that would necessitate his presence. But, no, you're correct, as an elected official he wouldn't report to anyone, per se, I don't think.
{{< /quote >}}

This structure means disciplinary decisions ultimately rest with {{< person "mat-king" >}} himself, with no external oversight authority.

## Timeline Context

|------|-------|
| Nov 6, 2022 | Marc King OWI arrest |
| Nov 6, 2022 | Scott Jones notifies command |
| Nov 9, 2022 | Union representative contacted |

## Why This Matters

### 1. Investigation Naming

The investigation title "Loyalty" frames the issue as a question of allegiance rather than procedural compliance, potentially influencing how findings were interpreted.

### 2. Parallel but Unequal Treatment

The contrast between how King and Jones investigations were handled—formal charges for one, none for the other—raises questions about consistent application of disciplinary standards.

### 3. No External Accountability

The Sheriff's position as an elected official with no reporting requirement means internal investigations operate without external oversight.

## Open Questions

- What specific policies were examined in the "Loyalty" investigation?
- Why was Jones' investigation framed around "loyalty" rather than policy compliance?
- What happened to the investigation after Jones' retirement?
- Were the outcomes for King and Jones consistent with how similar cases were handled previously?
