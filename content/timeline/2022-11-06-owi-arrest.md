## Incident Summary

On November 6, 2022, {{< person "marc-king" >}} of the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). This arrest set in motion a series of events that would expose systemic governance failures within the department.

## What Happened

### The Arrest

- {{< person "marc-king" >}} was arrested for drunk driving while off-duty
- He was transported to Lapeer County Jail (notably, not St. Clair County)
- The arrest was made by an outside agency

### Immediate Aftermath

- {{< person "mat-king" >}} (the arrestee's brother) was notified the same day
- The Sheriff contacted {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} and {{< person "jim-spadafore" >}}
- Command-level calls were made regarding the incident

## The Problem

**The issue is not that a deputy was arrested.** Law enforcement officers can make mistakes like anyone else.

**The issue is what happened next:**

1. {{< person "mat-king" >}} did not recuse himself despite being the arrestee's brother
2. No independent investigation was initiated
3. No external agency was engaged to handle the matter
4. Close friends of the arrestee were involved in the internal handling
5. Text messages were later deleted by multiple parties involved

## Why This Matters

When a law enforcement officer is accused of wrongdoing, public trust depends on an independent, transparent investigation. In this case:

- The top law enforcement official in the county had a direct family relationship with the subject
- No safeguards were activated to ensure independence
- The appearance of favoritism undermines public confidence in all department actions

## Key Questions

- Why was no external agency engaged to investigate?
- Why did the Sheriff not recuse himself?
- What communications occurred that were later deleted?
- What was the outcome of any internal investigation?
