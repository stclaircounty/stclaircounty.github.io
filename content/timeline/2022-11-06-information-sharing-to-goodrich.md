### Deputy Duva's Text Communications

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="8" deposition="duva-deposition" type="question" >}}
Did you call or text with Marcus about his OWI arrest in 2022?
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Deputy Damon Duva" page="8" deposition="duva-deposition" type="answer" >}}
I spoke with Marcus. I did not text him the night of his OWI arrest. No, I did not.
{{< /quote >}}

## Why This Matters

### 1. Personal Relationships Influenced Information Flow

The arrest information spread through friendship networks rather than official channels:
- Pohl described Goodrich as someone he "talk[s] daily with"
- Cronkright also contacted Goodrich directly
- This demonstrates how personal relationships within the department affected how sensitive information was handled

### 2. Evidence Was Subsequently Deleted

Multiple officers admitted under oath that relevant text messages were deleted:
- Captain Pohl no longer has his text communications
- Deputy Duva was questioned about deleted texts
- This raises questions about evidence preservation

### 3. Pattern of Informal Communication

The flow of information to a civilian friend (Goodrich) while official investigation procedures were unclear demonstrates:
- Lack of information security protocols
- Potential conflicts of interest
- Informal networks taking precedence over chain of command

## Connection to Other Events

- [OWI Arrest](/timeline/2022-11-06-owi-arrest/): The underlying arrest that triggered these communications
- [Evidence Deleted](/timeline/2022-2024-evidence-deleted/): Pattern of evidence deletion including these text messages
- [Sheriff Notified](/timeline/2022-11-06-sheriff-notified/): Official notification chain occurring in parallel

## Open Questions

1. Why was a civilian (Josh Goodrich) informed of internal department matters?
2. What role did Goodrich play that warranted notification?
3. Were any policies violated by sharing this information externally?
4. What other communications were deleted?
