## Our Mission

The St. Clair County Public Accountability Project is a public service resource for residents of St. Clair County, Michigan. We document corruption, legal matters, conflicts of interest, and accountability failures across county government — making public records accessible and understandable to the community.

We believe that transparency is essential to a functioning democracy. When public officials fail to follow the same rules they enforce on everyone else, the community has a right to know.

### Courts and Legal System
- Judicial conduct and rulings
- Prosecutorial practices
- Access to justice issues

### County Government
- Commission actions and oversight
- Public spending and contracts
- FOIA compliance and transparency

### Sheriff's Department Governance Failures (2022-Present)

On November 6, 2022, a St. Clair County deputy was arrested for drunk driving. He was the Sheriff's brother. What happened next raises serious questions about accountability:

**Undisputed Facts** (established by sworn testimony):
- Sheriff Mat King and Deputy Marc King are brothers
- Sheriff King was notified of his brother's arrest on November 6, 2022
- Sheriff King did not recuse himself from the matter
- No external agency was engaged to investigate
- Captain Pohl admitted to deleting text messages
- Deputy Duva admitted text messages are "no longer available"
- No litigation hold was established to preserve evidence

This case is documented in detail through depositions, timeline events, and evidence analysis throughout this site.

## Why It Matters {#why-it-matters}

Public trust in government depends on accountability. When oversight mechanisms fail:

- The public cannot trust that investigations are fair
- Officials who violate the law may escape consequences
- The appearance of favoritism undermines all government actions
- Evidence destruction prevents truth from emerging
- Corruption spreads when it goes unchecked
