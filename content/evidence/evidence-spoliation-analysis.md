## Overview

This analysis documents the destruction of evidence by St. Clair County Sheriff's Office personnel in connection with the November 2022 OWI arrest of {{< person "marc-king" >}}.

## What Was Destroyed

### Text Messages

Multiple officers admitted under oath to deleting text messages from the time period surrounding the November 6, 2022 incident:

{{< person slug="damon-duva" full="true" >}}

**{{< person "matthew-pohl" >}}**

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="246" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
Whatever text messages or phone calls that I'd referenced in my internal report, I no longer have those on my phone.

We don't have a policy.

**{{< person "damon-duva" >}}**

{{< quote source="Deputy Duva" page="16" deposition="duva-transcripts" type="question" >}}
Do you still have records of those calls and text messages?

{{< quote source="Deputy Duva" page="16" deposition="duva-transcripts" type="answer" >}}
I doubt it, no.

Have you deleted call logs or text messages reflecting communications between yourself and the sheriff in November of 2022? I'm sure I have, yes.

## Why It Matters

### Legal Doctrine: Spoliation

When a party destroys evidence relevant to litigation, courts apply the "spoliation doctrine":

1. **Adverse Inference**: Juries may be instructed to assume the destroyed evidence would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it

2. **Sanctions**: Courts can impose penalties including:
   - Monetary fines
   - Attorney fee awards
   - Adverse jury instructions
   - Case dismissal (in extreme cases)

3. **Criminal Liability**: Under Michigan law ({{< legal-cite statute="MCL 750.491" >}}), tampering with evidence is a criminal offense

### Pattern Analysis

The destruction of evidence by multiple officers, all of whom had close personal relationships with the arrestee, suggests:

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Multiple deletions | Not isolated incident |
| All close friends | Pattern of relationship |
| Same time period | Coordinated timing |
| No preservation | Systemic failure |

## Governance Failure

### No Litigation Hold

A "litigation hold" is a standard procedure requiring preservation of all potentially relevant documents when legal action is foreseeable.

In this case:
- An officer was arrested for a crime
- Litigation was clearly foreseeable
- No hold was established
- Evidence was destroyed

### No Retention Policy

The department had no effective policy for:
- Preserving communications on personal devices
- Documenting official business conducted via text
- Retaining records relevant to investigations

## Legal Exposure

### For Individual Officers

Officers who destroyed evidence face potential:
- Contempt findings in civil litigation
- Disciplinary action
- Criminal investigation referral
- Personal liability

### For the Department

The St. Clair County Sheriff's Office faces:
- Adverse inference in all related litigation
- Discovery sanctions
- Public integrity investigation
- Loss of public trust

## Questions That Cannot Be Answered

Because the evidence was destroyed, we cannot know:

- What did the deleted messages say?
- Who else was involved in communications?
- What decisions were made informally?
- Was there coordination to destroy evidence?
- What was the full extent of command involvement?

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **DOJ Referral**: Evidence destruction in connection with officer misconduct warrants federal review

2. **Michigan AG**: Public integrity investigation into evidence tampering

3. **Policy Reform**: Mandatory evidence retention and litigation hold procedures

4. **Oversight**: Independent review of department practices
