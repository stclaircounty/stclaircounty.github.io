## Overview

This analysis documents the destruction of evidence by St. Clair County Sheriff's Office personnel in connection with the November 2022 OWI arrest of Deputy Marc King.

## What Was Destroyed

### Text Messages

Multiple officers admitted under oath to deleting text messages from the time period surrounding the November 6, 2022 incident:

**Captain Matthew Pohl**
- Admitted to deleting text messages
- Close personal friend of Deputy Marc King
- Contacted by Sheriff Mat King on day of arrest

**Deputy Duva**
- Admitted text messages are "no longer available"
- Close personal friend of Deputy Marc King
- Involved in post-arrest communications

## Why It Matters

### Legal Doctrine: Spoliation

When a party destroys evidence relevant to litigation, courts apply the "spoliation doctrine":

1. **Adverse Inference**: Juries may be instructed to assume the destroyed evidence would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it

2. **Sanctions**: Courts can impose penalties including:
   - Monetary fines
   - Attorney fee awards
   - Adverse jury instructions
   - Case dismissal (in extreme cases)

3. **Criminal Liability**: Under Michigan law (MCL 750.491), tampering with evidence is a criminal offense

### Pattern Analysis

The destruction of evidence by multiple officers, all of whom had close personal relationships with the arrestee, suggests:

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Multiple deletions | Not isolated incident |
| All close friends | Pattern of relationship |
| Same time period | Coordinated timing |
| No preservation | Systemic failure |

## Governance Failure

### No Litigation Hold

A "litigation hold" is a standard procedure requiring preservation of all potentially relevant documents when legal action is foreseeable.

In this case:
- An officer was arrested for a crime
- Litigation was clearly foreseeable
- No hold was established
- Evidence was destroyed

### No Retention Policy

The department had no effective policy for:
- Preserving communications on personal devices
- Documenting official business conducted via text
- Retaining records relevant to investigations

## Legal Exposure

### For Individual Officers

Officers who destroyed evidence face potential:
- Contempt findings in civil litigation
- Disciplinary action
- Criminal investigation referral
- Personal liability

### For the Department

The St. Clair County Sheriff's Office faces:
- Adverse inference in all related litigation
- Discovery sanctions
- Public integrity investigation
- Loss of public trust

## Questions That Cannot Be Answered

Because the evidence was destroyed, we cannot know:

- What did the deleted messages say?
- Who else was involved in communications?
- What decisions were made informally?
- Was there coordination to destroy evidence?
- What was the full extent of command involvement?

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **DOJ Referral**: Evidence destruction in connection with officer misconduct warrants federal review

2. **Michigan AG**: Public integrity investigation into evidence tampering

3. **Policy Reform**: Mandatory evidence retention and litigation hold procedures

4. **Oversight**: Independent review of department practices
