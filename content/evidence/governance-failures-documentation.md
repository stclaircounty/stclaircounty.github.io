## Overview

This document analyzes the systemic governance failures exposed by the November 2022 OWI arrest of {{< person "marc-king" >}} and its aftermath. These failures are structural, not accidental.

## Failure 1: Unmitigated Conflict of Interest

### The Problem

{{< person "mat-king" >}} is the brother of {{< person "marc-king" >}}. When the deputy was arrested:

- The Sheriff was notified the same day
- The Sheriff did not recuse himself
- The Sheriff became directly involved in the matter
- No external agency was engaged

### Why It's a Failure

Conflict of interest rules exist to ensure:
- Fair and impartial decision-making
- Public confidence in outcomes
- Protection from favoritism
- Accountability mechanisms

When the highest law enforcement official in a county investigates his own brother, none of these goals can be achieved.

### What Should Have Happened

- Immediate recusal by {{< person "mat-king" >}}
- Notification to county administrators
- Engagement of Michigan State Police or neighboring sheriff
- Documentation of all communications

## Failure 2: No Independent Investigation

### The Problem

Officer misconduct investigations require independence to be credible. In this case:

- Investigation handled entirely internally
- No external agency involvement
- No independent investigator assigned
- Close friends of arrestee involved in handling

### Why It's a Failure

Internal investigation by colleagues and friends of the accused:
- Cannot be objective
- Will not be perceived as fair
- May miss or overlook evidence
- Undermines public trust

### What Should Have Happened

- External agency investigation (standard for officer arrests)
- Independent investigator with no personal ties
- Transparent process with documented findings
- Public reporting of outcome

## Failure 3: Evidence Governance

### The Problem

Multiple officers destroyed communications relevant to the incident:

- No litigation hold established
- No evidence retention policy enforced
- Personal devices used without preservation requirements
- Text messages deleted by key witnesses

### Why It's a Failure

Evidence preservation is fundamental to accountability:
- Cannot evaluate what happened without records
- Creates appearance of cover-up
- Exposes department to legal sanctions
- Violates public records obligations

### What Should Have Happened

- Immediate litigation hold when arrest occurred
- Preservation notice to all involved personnel
- Collection and preservation of all communications
- Documentation of chain of custody

## Failure 4: Oversight Deficiency

### The Problem

No oversight mechanism activated to address these failures:

- No county administrator intervention
- No board review
- No external audit
- No accountability for decision-makers

### Why It's a Failure

Oversight exists to catch failures before they compound:
- Should have flagged conflict of interest
- Should have required external investigation
- Should have ensured evidence preservation
- Should have demanded transparency

### What Should Have Happened

- County oversight of sheriff operations
- Automatic triggers for independent review
- Public reporting requirements
- Structural checks on sheriff authority

## Systemic Nature

These failures are not isolated mistakes. They represent systemic weaknesses:

| Failure | Root Cause |
|---------|-----------|
| No recusal | No mandatory recusal policy |
| No independence | No external investigation requirement |
| Evidence destruction | No retention/hold policies |
| No oversight | No structural accountability |

## Recommendations

### Policy Reforms Needed

1. **Mandatory Recusal**: Written policy requiring recusal for family and close personal relationships

2. **External Investigation**: Automatic engagement of outside agency for all officer misconduct

3. **Evidence Retention**: Comprehensive policy for preserving communications, including personal devices

4. **Oversight Structure**: County-level review authority with real power

### Accountability Measures

1. Review of all decisions made by conflicted parties
2. Independent investigation of evidence destruction
3. Public reporting of findings
4. Structural reforms to prevent recurrence

## Conclusion

The governance failures documented here allowed:
- A sheriff to investigate his own brother
- Close friends to handle the matter
- Evidence to be destroyed
- No accountability to occur

These failures are structural. Without reform, they will happen again.
