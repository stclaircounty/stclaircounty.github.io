## Overview

Spoliation of evidence refers to the intentional, reckless, or negligent withholding, hiding, altering, fabricating, or destroying of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding. Under Michigan law, courts may impose sanctions and draw adverse inferences when spoliation occurs.

## Legal Standard

Michigan courts apply a multi-factor analysis when evaluating spoliation claims:

1. **Existence of a duty to preserve** — Did the party have an obligation to preserve the evidence?
2. **Culpability** — Was the destruction intentional, reckless, or negligent?
3. **Relevance** — Was the destroyed evidence relevant to the claims or defenses?
4. **Prejudice** — Was the opposing party prejudiced by the destruction?

## Remedies and Sanctions

Courts may impose various sanctions for spoliation:

- **Adverse inference instruction** — Jury may presume destroyed evidence was unfavorable
- **Exclusion of evidence** — Related evidence may be excluded
- **Monetary sanctions** — Costs and attorney fees
- **Default judgment** — In extreme cases
- **Dismissal** — Of claims or defenses

## Duty to Preserve

A duty to preserve evidence arises when:
- Litigation is pending
- Litigation is reasonably anticipated
- A litigation hold is issued
- Government records retention policies require preservation

## Relevance

This statute is particularly relevant when:
- Text messages are deleted after litigation is filed
- Communication records are not preserved despite litigation holds
- Officials claim records are "no longer available"
- Devices are wiped or replaced during pending litigation
