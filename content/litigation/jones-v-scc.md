title: "Jones v. St. Clair County, et al."

## Case Background

This federal civil rights lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan following events that began on November 6, 2022. The case centers on allegations that Lieutenant Scott Jones was retaliated against for reporting concerns about how the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office handled the OWI arrest of Deputy Marc King, who is the brother of Sheriff Mat King.

## The Underlying Events

On November 6, 2022, Deputy Marc King was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). What followed raised significant questions about conflicts of interest and proper procedure:

- **Sheriff Mat King remained involved** in decisions about how to handle the arrest of his own brother
- **No external agency was brought in** to handle the investigation despite the obvious conflict
- **Lt. Scott Jones reported concerns** to Human Resources about the handling of the matter
- **Lt. Jones was subsequently pressured to retire**, allegedly in retaliation for his protected speech

## Legal Claims

### First Amendment Retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 1983)

The core claim alleges that Lt. Jones was retaliated against for engaging in protected speech when he reported his concerns about the handling of the Marc King arrest. The First Amendment protects public employees who speak on matters of public concern, and allegations of misconduct in a law enforcement agency clearly qualify.

### Procedural Due Process (Fourteenth Amendment)

The lawsuit also raises due process claims related to the circumstances of Lt. Jones's departure from the department.

### Municipal Liability (Monell)

Beyond the individual defendants, the case seeks to hold St. Clair County liable under *Monell v. Department of Social Services*, arguing that the county's policies, customs, or deliberate indifference enabled the alleged constitutional violations.

## Key Ruling: Summary Judgment Opinion (2025)

In a significant victory for the plaintiff, the court denied summary judgment on the key claims:

**First Amendment Claim Survives**: The court found sufficient evidence that Lt. Jones engaged in protected speech and that a reasonable jury could find he was retaliated against for that speech.

**Qualified Immunity Denied**: The defendants' assertion of qualified immunity was rejected for the surviving claims, meaning the case can proceed to trial on the merits.

**Monell Claim Proceeds**: The court allowed the municipal liability claim to proceed, finding sufficient evidence of policies or customs that may have contributed to the alleged violations.

## Why This Case Matters

This litigation represents a critical test of accountability in St. Clair County:

1. **Whistleblower Protection**: Can law enforcement officers report concerns without facing retaliation?

2. **Conflicts of Interest**: How should departments handle situations where family members of leadership are involved in misconduct?

3. **Municipal Accountability**: Can counties be held liable when their policies enable constitutional violations?

4. **First Amendment Rights**: What protections exist for public employees who speak out about matters of public concern?

## Court Documents

Key filings and rulings in this case are matters of public record and available through the federal court system (PACER).
