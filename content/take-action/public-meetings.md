### How to Make Public Comment

Most county commission meetings include a public comment period. Here's how to participate:

1. **Arrive early** — Sign up for public comment before the meeting starts
2. **State your name and address** — This is typically required
3. **Keep it brief** — You'll usually have 3 minutes
4. **Stay factual** — Reference specific depositions and documented evidence
5. **Be respectful** — Firm and factual is more effective than angry
6. **Bring written copies** — Offer to submit your statement for the record

### Sample Public Comment Script

> "Good evening. My name is [NAME] and I live at [ADDRESS in St. Clair County].
>
> I'm here tonight to address accountability concerns at the Sheriff's Office. Federal court depositions have revealed that Sheriff King investigated his own brother without recusal, and multiple officers have admitted under oath to deleting text messages that may have been evidence.
>
> I'm asking this board to:
> - Request an independent review of Sheriff's Office policies
> - Consider budget conditions requiring conflict of interest policies
> - Ensure evidence retention policies are in place
>
> These are not political requests. They are basic good governance practices that any law enforcement agency should follow.
>
> Thank you."

### Other Meetings to Attend

Your local township contracts with the Sheriff for services. Township boards can advocate for accountability measures.
