## DOJ Referral Framework

This document outlines the basis for referring the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office governance failures to federal authorities.

---

### Basis for Referral

#### Conflict of Interest

- Sheriff Mat King investigated a matter involving his own brother
- No recusal despite obvious familial conflict
- No external agency was engaged
- Close friends of the subject were involved in handling the matter

#### Evidence Spoliation

- Multiple officers admitted to deleting relevant communications
- Text messages destroyed after incident occurred
- No litigation hold established despite foreseeable legal action
- Pattern of evidence destruction across multiple witnesses

#### Lack of Neutrality

- Investigation handled entirely internally
- All involved parties had personal relationships with subject
- No independent oversight mechanism
- Appearance of favoritism undermines public trust

### Sample Complaint Language

> "I am writing to request a federal review of governance failures within the St. Clair County, Michigan Sheriff's Office. Sworn testimony has established that the Sheriff investigated a matter involving his own brother without recusal, that multiple officers destroyed relevant evidence (text messages), and that no independent oversight exists. These systemic failures undermine equal protection and public trust in law enforcement."
