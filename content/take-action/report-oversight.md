### Sample Complaint Letter

You can adapt this template for any oversight agency:

---

**Re: Request for Investigation — St. Clair County Sheriff's Office**

Dear [Agency]:

I am writing to request an investigation into governance failures at the St. Clair County, Michigan Sheriff's Office.

**Summary of Concerns:**

Sworn testimony in federal civil rights litigation (Jones v. St. Clair County, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan) has established:

1. **Conflict of Interest:** Sheriff Mat King investigated a matter directly involving his brother, Deputy Marc King, without recusal or referral to an external agency.

2. **Evidence Destruction:** Multiple officers, including Captain Matthew Pohl, admitted under oath to deleting text messages after the incident occurred. No litigation hold was established despite foreseeable legal action.

3. **Lack of Independent Oversight:** The investigation was handled entirely by individuals with personal relationships to the subject.

**Documentation:**

Deposition transcripts supporting these allegations are publicly available at [stclairunderoath.com].

**Request:**

I respectfully request that your office investigate whether these governance failures constitute violations of [applicable law] and whether systemic reforms are warranted.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your Contact Information]

### What Happens After You File

**Michigan Attorney General** — Reviews complaint, may request additional info, decides whether to investigate.

**DOJ Civil Rights** — Assesses for pattern-or-practice concerns, may open investigation or refer to local US Attorney.

**FBI** — Evaluates for federal criminal violations, may investigate or coordinate with DOJ.

Federal agencies receive many complaints and investigate selectively. Your complaint adds to the record even if no immediate action is taken. Multiple complaints about the same agency strengthen the case for investigation.

### Tips for Effective Complaints

- **Be specific** — Reference specific testimony, dates, and individuals
- **Be concise** — One page is often more effective than ten
- **Include sources** — Link to or attach supporting documentation
- **Follow up** — You can inquire about status after 60-90 days
- **Coordinate** — Encourage others to file similar complaints
