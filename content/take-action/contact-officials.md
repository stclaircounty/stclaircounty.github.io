### Sample Phone Script

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY]. I'm calling about concerns regarding accountability at the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office. Sworn testimony in federal court has revealed that the Sheriff investigated his own brother without recusal, and that multiple officers deleted text messages that may have been evidence. I'm asking the [Commissioner/Representative] to:
>
> 1. Support an independent review of Sheriff's Office policies
> 2. Require automatic recusal when family members are involved
> 3. Implement evidence retention policies
>
> Will the [Commissioner/Representative] commit to supporting these reforms? Can I get a response in writing?"

### Sample Email Template

**Subject:** Constituent Request: Sheriff's Office Accountability Reforms

Dear [Commissioner/Representative Name],

I am writing as a concerned St. Clair County resident regarding documented governance failures at the Sheriff's Office.

Federal court depositions have established that:
- {{< person "mat-king" >}} investigated a matter involving his own brother without recusal
- Multiple officers admitted to deleting text messages after the incident
- No independent oversight mechanism exists

I respectfully request that you:

1. **Support an independent policy review** of the Sheriff's Office
2. **Advocate for mandatory recusal policies** when investigations involve family members of command staff
3. **Require evidence retention policies** that preserve all communications

I would appreciate a written response outlining your position on these reforms.

Thank you for your service to our community.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your Phone/Email]

### Tips for Effective Contact

- **Be specific** — Reference the depositions and specific issues
- **Be persistent** — Follow up if you don't receive a response
- **Be respectful** — Angry calls are less effective than firm, factual ones
- **Document everything** — Keep records of who you contacted and what they said
- **Bring others** — Encourage friends and neighbors to contact officials too
- **Attend meetings** — Show up in person to county commission meetings
