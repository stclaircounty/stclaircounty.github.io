### Why This Matters

Sworn testimony revealed:

- No recusal despite a direct family relationship
- No evidence retention policies were followed
- No litigation hold was established
- Investigation was handled internally

Requesting these policies will reveal:

- Whether policies exist (or if there are gaps)
- Whether existing policies were followed
- What reforms are needed
- Evidence of systemic failures
