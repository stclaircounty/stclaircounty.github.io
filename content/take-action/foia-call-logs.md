### Why This Matters

According to sworn testimony:

- Sheriff King was notified of his brother's arrest on November 6, 2022
- Sheriff King contacted Captain Pohl and the Undersheriff
- "Command calls" were made

Call logs would document:

- Who called whom and when
- The timeline of notifications
- The extent of command involvement
- Whether protocols were followed
