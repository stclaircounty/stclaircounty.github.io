### What to Look For in an Attorney

**Experience with similar cases**
Ask how many police misconduct or civil rights cases they've handled. Request examples of outcomes.

**Contingency fee arrangements**
Many civil rights attorneys work on contingency (they only get paid if you win). Clarify fee structure upfront.

**Resources for your case**
Civil rights cases can be expensive to litigate. Does the firm have resources to take on well-funded government defendants?

**Communication style**
You'll be working together for potentially years. Make sure you're comfortable with their approach.

**Trial experience**
Many cases settle, but you want an attorney willing to go to trial if necessary.

### Questions to Ask During Consultation

1. Have you handled cases against this specific agency or municipality?
2. What's your assessment of my case's strengths and weaknesses?
3. What's the typical timeline for cases like this?
4. What are the potential outcomes (settlement, trial, damages)?
5. Who will actually be working on my case?
6. What do you need from me to move forward?
7. What are the costs, and how are fees structured?

### Before You Meet with an Attorney

**Document everything**
Write down what happened while it's fresh. Include dates, times, locations, and names.

**Gather evidence**
Collect any photos, videos, medical records, police reports, or witness information.

**Know the timeline**
Civil rights claims have deadlines (statutes of limitations). Don't wait too long.

**Prepare your questions**
Make a list of what you want to know about the process.

---

### Free and Low-Cost Options

**Law School Clinics**
University of Michigan, Wayne State, and other Michigan law schools have clinics that handle civil rights matters.

**Pro Bono Programs**
Many attorneys take a limited number of pro bono (free) cases each year. Ask about availability.

**Legal Aid Organizations**
Income-qualified individuals may receive free representation.

**Know Your Rights Clinics**
Community organizations often host free legal clinics where you can get initial advice.

### If You Can't Find an Attorney

Not every case will find representation. If you're having trouble:

- **File complaints anyway** — You can file with oversight agencies without an attorney
- **Document for the record** — Your account becomes part of the public record
- **Connect with advocacy groups** — Organizations may provide non-legal support
- **Consider small claims** — For limited damages, small claims court doesn't require an attorney

---

### Important Deadlines

**Federal civil rights claims (Section 1983)**
Generally 2-3 years depending on the underlying state statute of limitations.

**Michigan state claims**
Varies by claim type. Some require notice to the government within 6 months.

**FOIA appeals**
180 days for administrative appeal in Michigan.

Don't wait — consult an attorney as soon as possible to understand your deadlines.
