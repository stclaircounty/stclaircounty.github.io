## Know Your Rights

Understanding your rights is the first step to exercising them. Here's what you need to know in Michigan.

---

### Rights During Police Encounters

**You have the right to remain silent**
You don't have to answer questions beyond providing identification if required. Clearly state: "I am exercising my right to remain silent."

**You have the right to refuse searches**
Without a warrant, you can refuse consent to search your person, vehicle, or home. Clearly state: "I do not consent to a search."

**You have the right to an attorney**
If arrested, you have the right to an attorney before questioning. Clearly state: "I want a lawyer."

**You have the right to know why**
Ask: "Am I being detained, or am I free to go?" If detained, ask: "What is the reason for this stop?"

**You have the right to record**
In Michigan, you can record police in public spaces as long as you don't interfere with their duties.

---

### If You're Stopped by Police

**Stay calm**
Keep your hands visible. Don't run, resist, or argue.

**Be polite but firm**
You can assert your rights without being confrontational.

**Don't lie**
If you don't want to answer, say so. Don't make false statements.

**Remember details**
Note badge numbers, patrol car numbers, and agency.

**File complaints later**
If you believe your rights were violated, document everything and file complaints through proper channels.

### Rights to Record Police

**Michigan is a one-party consent state**
You can record conversations you're part of without others' consent.

**Recording in public is protected**
The First Amendment protects your right to record police performing duties in public.

**Don't interfere**
Stay at a safe distance and don't obstruct officers.

**They cannot delete your recordings**
Demanding you delete footage or seizing your phone without a warrant may violate your rights.

**Livestream if possible**
Live video can't be deleted if your phone is seized.
