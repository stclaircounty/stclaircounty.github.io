## What County Residents Should Know

### What Happened?

A deputy sheriff was arrested for drunk driving on November 6, 2022.

**He is the Sheriff's brother.**

---

### What's the Concern?

**Not the arrest — what happened afterward.**

---

### Key Issues

| Issue | What Happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **No independent investigation** | The Sheriff's Office investigated itself |
| **No recusal** | The Sheriff stayed involved in his brother's case |
| **Evidence disappeared** | Text messages were deleted by multiple officers |
| **No policies** | No rules required the Sheriff to step back |

---

### Why It Matters

The law must apply the same way to everyone.

When the Sheriff investigates his own brother:
- We can't trust the investigation was fair
- It looks like special treatment for insiders
- Public confidence in law enforcement is damaged

---

### The Facts (From Sworn Testimony)

These facts are not disputed — they come from depositions given under oath:

- ✓ Sheriff King and Deputy King are brothers
- ✓ Sheriff King was notified of the arrest the same day
- ✓ Sheriff King did not recuse himself
- ✓ No external agency was engaged
- ✓ Captain Pohl admitted to deleting texts
- ✓ Deputy Duva admitted texts are "no longer available"

---

### What Residents Can Ask For

1. **Independent oversight** — External investigations for matters involving command staff
2. **Clear recusal rules** — Written policies requiring step-back when conflicts exist
3. **Evidence retention** — Stop deleting public records
4. **Accountability** — Review of past decisions, consequences for policy violations
