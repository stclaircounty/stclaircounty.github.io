## Speaker Notes — Town Hall Use

Use these notes when speaking at county commissioner meetings, town halls, or community events.

---

### Opening (Calm and measured)

> "Good evening. I'm here to talk about process, not politics. About systems, not personalities."

> "I want to discuss what happens when our accountability systems don't work — and what we can do to fix them."

---

### Key Points to Emphasize

#### 1. Equal Treatment Matters

> "When a deputy was arrested, the investigation was handled by his brother — the Sheriff. This isn't about whether the deputy did something wrong. It's about whether the investigation was fair."

> "Every resident of this county deserves to know that investigations are conducted impartially. That's not what happened here."

#### 2. Independence Protects Everyone

> "Independent investigations aren't about distrusting our officers. They're about protecting everyone — including the officers themselves."

> "When an external agency investigates, there's no question about fairness. The outcome is credible, whatever it is."

#### 3. Missing Records Damage Trust

> "Multiple officers have admitted, under oath, that text messages were deleted. These were communications about an arrest that was obviously going to involve legal proceedings."

> "We don't know what was in those messages. And that's the problem — we can never know now."

### Handling Questions

**"Are you saying the Sheriff is corrupt?"**

> "I'm saying the process was compromised by a conflict of interest. Whether anyone acted with bad intent isn't for me to say — but the system should have prevented this situation entirely."

**"What do you want?"**

> "I want policies that work no matter who is involved. Mandatory recusal. Independent investigations. Evidence preservation. These are basic accountability measures."

**"This sounds political."**

> "Accountability isn't partisan. Every resident, regardless of political views, deserves a sheriff's office that follows proper procedures."

---

### Closing

> "We're not asking for anything radical. We're asking for systems that work the same way for everyone — including the Sheriff's family."

> "Other counties have these policies. There's no reason St. Clair County can't adopt them too."

> "Thank you for your time."
