### Slide 4: What Went Wrong

## Governance Failures

| What Should Happen | What Did Happen |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Sheriff recuses himself | No recusal |
| External agency investigates | Internal handling only |
| Evidence preserved | Text messages deleted |
| Independent oversight | None |

---

### Slide 5: The Evidence

## From Sworn Testimony

- ✓ Sheriff did not recuse himself
- ✓ No external agency was engaged
- ✓ Captain Pohl admitted deleting texts
- ✓ Deputy Duva admitted texts are gone
- ✓ No litigation hold was established

*All facts from depositions given under oath*

---

### Slide 6: Why It Matters

## Public Trust Requires:

- **Impartiality** — Investigations free from bias
- **Independence** — No self-investigation
- **Preservation** — Evidence maintained, not destroyed
- **Accountability** — Consequences for failures

## When These Fail:

- Trust erodes
- Justice is questioned
- Everyone suffers

---

### Slide 7: The Core Question

> "What happens when the law applies to the Sheriff's own family?"

In St. Clair County, the answer was:

**Instead of stepping back, leadership stepped in.**

---

### Slide 8: What Needs to Change

## Required Reforms

1. **Mandatory Recusal Policy**
   - Automatic when family/friends involved

2. **Independent Investigations**

3. **Evidence Retention**
