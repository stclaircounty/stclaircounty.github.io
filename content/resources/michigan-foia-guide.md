## Michigan FOIA Guide

The Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives you the right to access public records. This guide explains how to use it effectively.

---

### What is FOIA?

The Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231-15.246) requires public bodies to disclose records upon request, with limited exemptions. It's one of your most powerful tools for government accountability.

**Who must comply:**
- State agencies
- Counties and municipalities
- School districts
- Police and sheriff departments
- Courts (administrative records)
- Any body funded by public money

---

### What Records Can You Request?

**Public records include:**
- Emails and correspondence
- Text messages on government business
- Reports and studies
- Meeting minutes and agendas
- Contracts and purchase orders
- Policies and procedures
- Personnel records (with limitations)
- Body camera and dash camera footage
- 911 calls and dispatch logs
- Incident and arrest reports

**Records on personal devices:**
If a public employee uses a personal phone or email for government business, those communications are still public records.

---

### How to Submit a Request

**Step 1: Identify the FOIA Coordinator**
Each public body has a designated FOIA coordinator. Check their website or call the main office.

**Step 2: Submit in Writing**
Requests should be in writing (email, mail, or online portal). Include:
- Your name and contact information
- Specific description of records sought
- Date ranges if applicable
- Preferred format (electronic preferred)

**Step 3: Be Specific**
The more specific your request, the faster and cheaper the response. Instead of "all emails," try "emails between [person] and [person] regarding [topic] from [date] to [date]."

### Sample FOIA Request

```
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST

To: [Agency Name] FOIA Coordinator
From: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Email: [Your Email]
Phone: [Your Phone]

Pursuant to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et seq.),
I request copies of the following records:

1. [Specific description of records]

2. [Date range if applicable]

3. [Names of individuals if relevant]

I request these records in electronic format if available.

I request a fee waiver as this information is in the public interest
and will contribute to public understanding of government operations.

If fees exceed $[amount], please contact me before proceeding.

Please respond within the time limits required by law.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

---

### Response Deadlines

**Initial response: 5 business days**
The agency must respond within 5 business days by:
- Granting the request
- Denying the request (with explanation)
- Requesting a 10-day extension

**Extension: Up to 10 additional business days**
Agencies can extend for "unusual circumstances" but must explain why.

**Failure to respond**
No response within the deadline is treated as a denial, and you can appeal.

---

### Fees and Fee Waivers

**What agencies can charge:**
- Labor costs for searching and reviewing records
- Copying costs (paper or electronic)
- Mailing costs

**What they cannot charge:**
- Overhead or administrative costs beyond labor
- Costs to separate exempt from non-exempt material

**Fee waivers**
Agencies must waive fees when:
- The request is in the public interest
- The requester is indigent
- Releasing the records primarily benefits the general public

**Request a fee estimate**
Always ask for an estimate before they begin work. You can narrow your request if costs are too high.

---

### Exemptions

Not all records are public. Common exemptions include:

**Privacy exemptions**
- Medical records
- Student records
- Home addresses of law enforcement

**Law enforcement exemptions**
- Ongoing criminal investigations
- Confidential informant identities
- Records that would interfere with enforcement proceedings

**Other exemptions**
- Attorney-client privilege
- Trade secrets
- Internal policy deliberations (limited)

**Partial disclosure**
If a record contains both exempt and non-exempt information, the agency must redact the exempt portions and release the rest.

---

### If Your Request is Denied

**Step 1: Administrative Appeal**
Write to the head of the agency within 180 days. They must respond within 10 business days.

**Step 2: Circuit Court Appeal**
If the administrative appeal fails, you can file suit in circuit court. You must file within 180 days of the final denial.

**Attorney fees**
If you prevail in court, the agency may be required to pay your attorney fees.

---

### Sample Appeal Letter

```
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT APPEAL

To: [Agency Head Name and Title]
From: [Your Name]
Date: [Date]
Re: Appeal of FOIA Denial dated [Date]

I am appealing the denial of my FOIA request dated [date] for the
following records: [describe records].

The denial cited [exemption]. I believe this exemption does not apply
because [explain reasoning].

Alternatively, even if some portions are exempt, the agency should
release non-exempt portions with appropriate redactions.

Please respond within the 10 business days required by MCL 15.240(2).

[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

### Tips for Effective FOIA Requests

**Be persistent**
Agencies sometimes deny requests hoping you'll go away. Appeals often succeed.

**Start narrow**
A focused request gets faster, cheaper results. You can always request more.

**Request electronic copies**
Cheaper and faster than paper.

**Keep records**
Save all correspondence, track deadlines, note who you spoke with.

**Follow up**
If you don't hear back, call or email. Document the contact.

**Compare responses**
If one agency claims records don't exist, another agency might have copies.

**Use what you get**
Even partial responses can reveal what else to request.

---

### Red Flags in Responses

**"No responsive records"**
Sometimes true, sometimes not. Consider whether the records should exist and whether to appeal.

**Excessive fees**
Get itemized estimates. Challenge unreasonable charges.

**Overly broad exemptions**
Agencies sometimes claim exemptions that don't apply. Research the specific exemption cited.

**Delayed responses**
Track deadlines carefully. Missed deadlines give you appeal rights.

**Heavy redactions**
Challenge if redactions seem excessive or unexplained.
