## Incident Overview

On November 6, 2022, Deputy Marc King of the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). The arrest itself was handled properly by an outside agency. **What happened afterward is the focus of this documentation.**

## The Core Problem

Deputy Marc King is the **brother** of Sheriff Mat King, the elected Sheriff of St. Clair County. When a deputy is arrested for a crime, standard practice calls for an independent investigation, typically by an external agency, to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

**That did not happen here.**

## Sequence of Events

### November 6, 2022

1. Deputy Marc King arrested for OWI
2. Transported to Lapeer County Jail
3. Sheriff Mat King notified the same day
4. Sheriff contacts Captain Matthew Pohl
5. Sheriff contacts the Undersheriff
6. Command-level discussions begin

### Post-Arrest Handling

- **No recusal**: Sheriff King did not recuse himself
- **No external agency**: Investigation handled internally
- **Personal relationships**: Close friends of the arrestee involved
- **Informal communications**: Off-the-record discussions occurred

### 2022-2024

- Text messages deleted by Captain Pohl
- Text messages deleted/lost by Deputy Duva
- No litigation hold established
- No evidence retention protocols followed

## Governance Failures

### 1. Conflict of Interest - Unmitigated

The Sheriff of the county was the brother of the arrested deputy. Despite this obvious conflict:

- No written policy required recusal
- No recusal occurred
- The Sheriff maintained direct involvement

### 2. No Independent Oversight

When an officer is accused of misconduct, independent investigation is essential:

- No external agency was engaged
- No independent investigator was assigned
- All handling remained within the department

### 3. Evidence Spoliation

Multiple officers destroyed relevant communications:

| Officer | Relationship | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Captain Pohl | Close Friend | Deleted texts |
| Deputy Duva | Close Friend | Deleted texts |

### 4. No Preservation Protocols

Despite foreseeable litigation:

- No litigation hold was established
- No document preservation occurred
- Personal devices used without retention requirements

## Legal Exposure

### Michigan Law

- **MCL 750.491**: Evidence tampering
- **FOIA violations**: Destruction of public records

### Federal Law

- **42 U.S.C. § 1983**: Civil rights implications
- **Spoliation doctrine**: Adverse inference in litigation

## Why This Matters

> "This case is about what happens when the law applies to the Sheriff's own family. Instead of stepping back, leadership stepped in."

The integrity of law enforcement depends on public trust. When an officer is arrested:

- The public needs to know the investigation was fair
- Close relationships should disqualify participants
- Evidence must be preserved
- Independent oversight is essential

In St. Clair County, none of these safeguards worked.

## What Residents Should Know

**The issue is not the arrest.** Deputies, like all people, can make mistakes.

**The issue is the response:**

- No independent investigation
- Sheriff investigated his own brother
- Evidence disappeared
- No accountability mechanisms activated

## Recommended Actions

Based on the evidence documented here, appropriate responses include:

1. **DOJ Civil Rights Division** referral
2. **Michigan Attorney General** Public Integrity investigation
3. **County oversight** structural reforms
4. **Policy changes** requiring:
   - Mandatory recusal for family conflicts
   - External investigation of officer misconduct
   - Evidence retention and litigation hold procedures
   - Independent oversight mechanisms

## Available Evidence

- Sheriff Mat King Deposition
- Captain Matthew Pohl Deposition
- Deputy Duva Transcripts
- Documentation packages with detailed analysis
