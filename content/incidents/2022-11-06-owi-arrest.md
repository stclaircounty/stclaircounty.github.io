## Incident Overview

On November 6, 2022, {{< person "marc-king" >}} of the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office was arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). The arrest itself was handled properly by an outside agency. **What happened afterward is the focus of this documentation.**

## The Core Problem

{{< person "marc-king" >}} is the **brother** of {{< person "mat-king" >}}, the elected Sheriff of St. Clair County. When a deputy is arrested for a crime, standard practice calls for an independent investigation, typically by an external agency, to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

**That did not happen here.**

## Sequence of Events

### November 6, 2022

1. {{< person "marc-king" >}} arrested for OWI
2. Transported to Lapeer County Jail
3. {{< person "mat-king" >}} notified the same day
4. Sheriff contacts {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}}
5. Sheriff contacts {{< person "jim-spadafore" >}}
6. Command-level discussions begin

### Post-Arrest Handling

- **No recusal**: {{< person "mat-king" >}} did not recuse himself
- **No external agency**: Investigation handled internally
- **Personal relationships**: Close friends of the arrestee involved
- **Informal communications**: Off-the-record discussions occurred

### 2022-2024

- Text messages deleted by {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}}
- Text messages deleted/lost by {{< person "damon-duva" >}}
- No litigation hold established
- No evidence retention protocols followed

## Governance Failures

### 1. Conflict of Interest - Unmitigated

The Sheriff of the county was the brother of the arrested deputy. Despite this obvious conflict:

- No written policy required recusal
- No recusal occurred
- The Sheriff maintained direct involvement

### 2. No Independent Oversight

When an officer is accused of misconduct, independent investigation is essential:

- No external agency was engaged
- No independent investigator was assigned
- All handling remained within the department

### 3. Evidence Spoliation

Multiple officers destroyed relevant communications:

| Officer | Relationship | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| {{< person "matthew-pohl" >}} | Close Friend | Deleted texts |
| {{< person "damon-duva" >}} | Close Friend | Deleted texts |

### 4. No Preservation Protocols

Despite foreseeable litigation:

- No litigation hold was established
- No document preservation occurred
- Personal devices used without retention requirements

## Legal Exposure

### Michigan Law

- {{< legal-cite statute="MCL 750.491" >}}: Evidence tampering
- **FOIA violations**: Destruction of public records

### Federal Law

- {{< legal-cite statute="42 U.S.C. § 1983" >}}: Civil rights implications
- **Spoliation doctrine**: Adverse inference in litigation

## Why This Matters

{{< quote >}}
This case is about what happens when the law applies to the Sheriff's own family. Instead of stepping back, leadership stepped in.

### Key Testimony

{{< quote source="Sheriff Mat King" page="74" deposition="mat-king-deposition" type="answer" >}}
He deliberately withheld information from myself and admitted so.

{{< quote source="Captain Matthew Pohl" page="246" deposition="pohl-deposition" type="answer" >}}
Whatever text messages or phone calls that I'd referenced in my internal report, I no longer have those on my phone.

{{< quote source="Deputy Duva" page="17" deposition="duva-transcripts" type="answer" >}}
Have you deleted call logs or text messages reflecting communications between yourself and the sheriff in November of 2022? I'm sure I have, yes.
{{< /quote >}}

The integrity of law enforcement depends on public trust. When an officer is arrested:

- The public needs to know the investigation was fair
- Close relationships should disqualify participants
- Evidence must be preserved
- Independent oversight is essential

In St. Clair County, none of these safeguards worked.

## What Residents Should Know

**The issue is not the arrest.** Deputies, like all people, can make mistakes.

**The issue is the response:**

- No independent investigation
- Sheriff investigated his own brother
- Evidence disappeared
- No accountability mechanisms activated

## Recommended Actions

Based on the evidence documented here, appropriate responses include:

1. **DOJ Civil Rights Division** referral
2. **Michigan Attorney General** Public Integrity investigation
3. **County oversight** structural reforms
4. **Policy changes** requiring:
   - Mandatory recusal for family conflicts
   - External investigation of officer misconduct
   - Evidence retention and litigation hold procedures
   - Independent oversight mechanisms

## Available Evidence

- {{< evidence "mat-king-deposition" >}}
- {{< evidence "pohl-deposition" >}}
- {{< evidence "duva-transcripts" >}}
- Documentation packages with detailed analysis
