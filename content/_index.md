When those in power fail to follow the rules they enforce on everyone else, the public has a right to know.

This site is a public resource for St. Clair County residents — documenting corruption, conflicts of interest, and accountability failures across county government through official records, court filings, and sworn testimony.

**Currently Featured:** The November 2022 Sheriff's Department incident involving evidence spoliation and conflict of interest failures following the arrest of the Sheriff's brother.
