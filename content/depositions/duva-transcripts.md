## Transcript Overview

These transcripts contain sworn testimony from Deputy Duva regarding involvement in communications following Deputy Marc King's November 2022 OWI arrest, including admissions about deleted or lost text messages.

## Key Issues Addressed

### Personal Relationship

Deputy Duva acknowledged a close friendship with Deputy Marc King:

- Personal relationship outside of professional duties
- Social connections that could affect objectivity
- Involvement in communications after the arrest

### Missing Communications

**Critical testimony regarding deleted evidence:**

Deputy Duva admitted under oath that text messages from the time period surrounding the November 2022 incident are no longer available:

- Messages were deleted or lost
- No preservation efforts were made
- The content of these communications cannot be recovered
- No explanation provided for why messages were not preserved

## Pattern of Evidence Destruction

Deputy Duva's admission is significant because it establishes a pattern:

| Officer | Relationship | Evidence Status |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Captain Pohl | Close Friend | Deleted Texts |
| Deputy Duva | Close Friend | Deleted Texts |

Both officers who were close friends of the arrestee deleted relevant communications. This pattern raises serious questions about:

- Coordination between officers
- Intent to conceal information
- Department culture around evidence preservation
- Accountability mechanisms

## Legal Significance

### Spoliation Doctrine

The destruction of evidence by multiple witnesses compounds the legal exposure:

- Adverse inference applies to all deleted communications
- Pattern suggests intentional destruction rather than accident
- Strengthens arguments for sanctions in litigation

### Public Integrity Concerns

When multiple officers delete evidence related to the same incident:

- Public trust is undermined
- Accountability mechanisms have failed
- External investigation is warranted

## Credibility Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Relationship to Arrestee | Close Friend |
| Evidence Handling | Deleted/Lost Texts |
| Neutrality | **Compromised** |
