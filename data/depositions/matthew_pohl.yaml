  text: He said how much did he drink at Tailgators Bar. He said he was there for
    -- he was there for approximately one and a half hours. Within that timeframe
    how much alcohol he believed he consumed; he said two Michelob Ultra Beers and
    one shot. So I can't necessarily say that was a lie that -- he may have just had
    two beers and a shot in the hour and a half at Tailgators Bar, I don't know.

    arrest occurs, he's handcuffed, and the next -- and the document says we then
    transported Marcus King to Lapeer County Jail by direction of Lieutenant Jones
    to be processed and logged. At Lapeer County Jail Marcus was read his Michigan
    Chemical Test Rights verbatim. Marcus verbally consented to a breath test and
    after a 15-minute operation period Marcus showed BAC of .18 at approximately 2:04
    a.m.; correct?

  text: I had gotten through a series of questions. The final question before the
    break was surrounding Scott Jones' knowledge of the bachelorette party that evening
    that had been broadcasted on social media, and he told me that he didn't know
    about that. I'd just reviewed the in-car video that morning, which contradicted
    his statement, that showed that he and Marc King had a conversation about the
    bachelorette party. That also kind of concluded the bullet points that I was trying
    to cover with Scott, so at that point I took a break.
