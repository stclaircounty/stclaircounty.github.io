    obviously, those two blend from time to time. My secretary, Andrea, handles things

    we'll talk to the union to make sure that we're not missing something, that the
    rule might overstep like employee rights to contract and to make sure that we're
    kind of on the same page where it's agreeable to the union members that this rule
    that we're trying to enact might not -- is not interfering with what they believe
    the contract says. Contract negotiations -- there's a policy for awards in the
    department. The award board is to be made up of somebody from the union body.
    So there's different levels of interactions.

  text: Well, at one point, we knew we wanted to talk to Scott irregardless of the
    leak, because he was obviously there during the arrest, and just to break down
    the arrest of an employee. We also talked about the fact that he was brought to
    another county and didn't notify me. We attempted to get ahold of Scott, and he
    took his next four shifts off work and wasn't answering phone calls and texts.
    At that point, suspicions raised as the amount of specific details came out and
    his not getting back in touch with us and mysteriously taking the four next shifts
    off after the arrest. And we knew we needed to conduct an internal investigation
    into the leaks and some other things that happened that night.
