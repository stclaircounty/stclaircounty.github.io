    was appointed interim Sheriff by a panel consisting of Prosecutor Mike
    Wendling, Probate Judge Elwood Brown, and County Clerk Jay DeBoyer, per
    Michigan statute. His elected term officially began January 1, 2021.

  notes: |
    Incumbent Sheriff Mat King defeated challenger Warren Head in the
    Republican primary. Head, the Yale Police Chief, cited concerns about
    departmental conduct and specifically referenced "the situation
    surrounding the lawsuit by former Sheriff's Lieutenant Scott Jones"
    as motivation for his candidacy. No Democratic candidate filed for
    the position, making the primary effectively the general election.

  notes: |
    Mat King re-elected as Sheriff despite ongoing litigation (Jones v.
    St. Clair County) and accountability concerns. Warren Head, who lost
    the August primary by 2,856 votes, continued as a write-in candidate
    in the general election. Head had specifically cited the Jones lawsuit
    and concerns about departmental conduct as reasons for his candidacy.

    This election occurred while federal litigation alleging First Amendment
    retaliation was pending against Sheriff King and other department officials.
  context:
    litigation_pending:
      - case: "Jones v. St. Clair County"
        status: "Qualified immunity denied; case proceeding"
    challenger_motivation: |
      Warren Head stated he became aware of issues "that were not proper"
      and cited the Jones lawsuit as an example of his concerns.
