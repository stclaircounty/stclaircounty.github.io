  title: "Deputy Marc King Arrested for OWI"
  date: 2022-11-06
  time: "22:00:00"
  location: "St. Clair County, Michigan"
  event_type: arrest
  incident_type: owi-arrest
  severity: critical
  summary: |
    Deputy Marc King arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) while off-duty.
    Transported to Lapeer County Jail. Arrest handled by outside agency.
  details:
    - "Deputy Marc King arrested for drunk driving while off-duty"
    - "Transported to Lapeer County Jail (not St. Clair County)"

  significance: |
    The arrest itself was handled properly by an outside agency. What happened
    afterward is the focus of accountability concerns.

2022-11-06-lapeer-jail-transport:
  title: "Deputy Marc King Transported to Lapeer County Jail"
  date: 2022-11-06
  time: "22:30:00"
  location: "Lapeer County Jail, Michigan"
  event_type: transport
  incident_type: custody
  severity: high
  summary: |
    After OWI arrest, Deputy Marc King was transported to Lapeer County Jail rather
    than St. Clair County facilities. A hold was placed due to BAC level, requiring
    him to remain in custody until sober.
  details:
    - "Transported to Lapeer County Jail (outside St. Clair County jurisdiction)"
    - "BAC level resulted in mandatory hold at the jail"
    - "Proper procedure followed by arresting agency"
    - "Held until BAC dropped to safe release level"
  significance: |
    The use of Lapeer County facilities shows the arrest was initially handled
    properly by an outside agency—making the subsequent internal handling by
    St. Clair County command staff more troubling.

2022-11-06-pohl-texts-goodrich:
  title: "Captain Pohl Texts Deputy Goodrich About Arrest"
  date: 2022-11-06
  time: "17:44:00"
  location: "St. Clair County"
  event_type: communication
  incident_type: information-dissemination
  severity: medium
  summary: |
    At 5:44 PM, Captain Matthew Pohl texted Deputy Josh Goodrich—a friend he
    communicated with daily—informing him of Marc King's OWI arrest. This shows
    how quickly the incident spread through informal department channels.
  details:
    - "Pohl texted Goodrich at exactly 5:44 PM on November 6, 2022"
    - "Goodrich described as someone Pohl 'talks daily with'"
    - "Message content: 'Marc got an OWI'"
    - "Demonstrates rapid informal dissemination of sensitive information"
  significance: |
    This text message, admitted in Pohl's deposition, demonstrates how news of the
    arrest spread through informal channels. It also establishes that Pohl was
    communicating about the matter via text—messages he later admitted to deleting.

  title: "Sheriff Mat King Notified of Brother's Arrest"
  date: 2022-11-06
  time: "23:00:00"
  location: "St. Clair County Sheriff's Office"
  event_type: notification
  incident_type: command-notification
  severity: high
  summary: |
    Sheriff Mat King notified of his brother's arrest the same day. Rather than
    recusing himself, he became directly involved in the matter.
  details:
    - "Sheriff Mat King learned of his brother's arrest on November 6, 2022"
    - "He contacted Captain Matthew Pohl regarding the incident"
    - "He contacted the Undersheriff"
    - "Command-level discussions occurred about how to handle the matter"
  failure_point:
    should_have:
      - "Sheriff King should have immediately recused himself"
      - "An external agency should have been contacted"
      - "All communications should have been documented"
      - "A clear chain of custody should have been established"
    actually_happened:
      - "No recusal occurred"
      - "No external agency was engaged"
      - "The Sheriff maintained involvement in the matter"
      - "Communications were handled informally"
      - "Text messages were later deleted"
  significance: |
    This was the critical moment where proper governance should have intervened.
    When the Sheriff chose not to recuse himself, every subsequent action was
    tainted by the conflict of interest.

    description: "Exact deletion dates unknown; discovered through depositions"
  location: "St. Clair County Sheriff's Office"
  event_type: evidence-destruction
  incident_type: evidence-spoliation
  severity: critical
  summary: |
    Multiple officers involved in the Marc King matter admitted in sworn testimony
    that text messages relevant to the incident were deleted or lost.
  details:
    - "Captain Pohl admitted in deposition to deleting text messages"
    - "Deputy Duva admitted text messages are 'no longer available'"
    - "No litigation hold was established"
    - "No retention policies were enforced"

    - "Discovery Sanctions: Penalties for destroying relevant evidence"
    - "Evidence Tampering: MCL 750.491 criminal offense"
    - "Spoliation Doctrine: Severe legal consequences"
  significance: |
    The fact that multiple officers—all close to the arrestee—deleted communications
    suggests coordination rather than coincidental data loss.

2022-11-internal-investigation:
  title: "Internal Investigation Initiated - No External Agency"
  date: 2022-11-15
  location: "St. Clair County Sheriff's Office"
  event_type: investigation
  incident_type: internal-investigation
  severity: high
  summary: |
    St. Clair County Sheriff's Office initiated an internal investigation into
    Deputy Marc King's OWI arrest. Despite the obvious conflict of interest—the
    arrestee being the Sheriff's brother—no external agency was engaged.
  details:
    - "Investigation conducted internally by the department"
    - "No external agency brought in despite conflict of interest"
    - "Sheriff Mat King remained involved despite being arrestee's brother"
    - "Captain Pohl—a close friend of the arrestee—was involved in handling"
    - "No findings or discipline publicly documented"
  failure_point:
    should_have:
      - "External agency should have conducted the investigation"
      - "Sheriff should have recused himself entirely"
      - "Officers with personal relationships should have been excluded"
      - "All communications should have been preserved"
    actually_happened:
      - "Investigation remained internal"
      - "Sheriff remained involved"
      - "Friends of arrestee involved in handling"
      - "Communications were later deleted"
  significance: |
    The decision to handle the investigation internally, with the Sheriff's continued
    involvement and his brother's friends participating, represents a fundamental
    governance failure that undermined any possibility of objective review.
