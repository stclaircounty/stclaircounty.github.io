    Elected Sheriff of St. Clair County, Michigan. When his brother Marc King
    was arrested for drunk driving, Sheriff King failed to recuse himself
    from the matter. Instead, he remained involved as the department he leads
    conducted its own internal investigation into the arrest of his own sibling.
    A federal judge denied him qualified immunity, allowing the civil rights
    lawsuit against him to proceed.

    Failed to recuse despite direct family relationship with arrestee.

    Deputy sheriff and brother of Sheriff Mat King. Arrested for Operating
    While Intoxicated (OWI) on November 6, 2022. Rather than being processed

    Captain Pohl, while his brother the Sheriff failed to recuse himself.
