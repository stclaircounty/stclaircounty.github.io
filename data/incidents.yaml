  summary: |
    Deputy Marc King arrested for Operating While Intoxicated (OWI). The deputy
    is the brother of Sheriff Mat King. While the arrest itself was properly handled
    by an outside agency (Lapeer County), the subsequent internal handling by
    St. Clair County was compromised. Sheriff King did not recuse himself, the
    investigation remained internal, and evidence was subsequently destroyed by
    multiple officers who were friends of the arrestee.
